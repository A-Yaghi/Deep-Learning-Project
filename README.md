# Deep-Learning-Project
This project's aim is using an autoencoder with transformers architecture for the task of image inpainting. A labelled images dataset was used, initially without labels for the self-supervised learning of the autoencoders, and then with labels for fine tuning. 75% of the image was masked, and the goal was to reconstruct the images back.
